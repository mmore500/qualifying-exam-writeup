# Fall 2018 Qualifying Examination

Dear Matthew,

Attached is your qualifying examination.
The written portion of your examination should be submitted electronically to Steven Smith, me, and all members of your qualifying examination committee by 5pm of Friday, August 31.
Your committee is CC'd on this email.
Your committee are the faculty excluding your advisor.


You must take the lead in scheduling the oral presentation with the qualifying examination committee which ideally would occur in the week of Monday September  17 (but can be earlier or later if that fits everyone’s schedule better).
You may wish to use a service like WhenIsGood to help with the scheduling, though some faculty do not like filling out all the choices in such services and prefer that you contact them to get available times.
WhenIsGood is preferable to something like doodle as you can more compactly include a range of choices and faculty can easily "paint" in their available times rather than having to click on a lot of different buttons.
Please don't wait until the last minute to schedule the oral presentation.
You can begin this scheduling before you turn in the written portion of your examination.
Please cc Steve Smith and me when you communicate with your committee so that we can more quickly assist you if any scheduling difficulties arise.


This is an examination.
You should do this exam (both the written portion and the oral portion) with no interaction with your advisor (EXCEPT to approve your selected papers), other faculty, other students, or even your family (for proofreading, etc).
The committee will take into account that this examination has been entirely prepared by you with no outside help when evaluating your performance.


In preparing your written document and your oral presentation, you should view this as a regular scholarly paper.
In particular, you should avoid plagiarism at all costs.
It is fine to use portions of the assigned papers in your document (key figures, definitions, etc), but these should be properly cited.
We will run your written document through iThenticate.

I wish to emphasize that your written paper and oral presentation must synthesize the three papers you select.
One issue we saw in the last round of qualifiers is that several students presented basically three paper reports loosely tied together with no real synthesis or combined analysis.
Synthesis is a requirement, and you should choose papers that allow you to successfully compare and contrast the chosen papers.


While I have stated you cannot receive help from others as you prepare your examination, you are allowed to ask questions.
If you have a content question, send an email to the qualifying examination committee cc’d to Steven and me stating your question.
The committee will provide a response also cc’d to the entire committee, me and Steven.
If you have a procedural question, send me an email and I will respond as quickly as possible.


Good luck and best wishes,
