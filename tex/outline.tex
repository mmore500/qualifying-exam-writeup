What is heterogeneousness?
\begin{itemize}
\item what it's not: homogeneousness

Why is cooperation among heterogeneous agents beneficial?
\begin{itemize}
\item variation in roles (division of labor)
\item variation in controller type (buffet/representation)
\item variation in unit type
+ more units available
+ great for division of labor!
  - ex hand, foot, eye bots \cite{dorigo2013novel}
  - ex warfighting coordination swarm/ground robot of DARPA
  - ex ground/swarm morphology \cite{mathews2012supervised}
  - ex The idea is to have autonomous robotic modules with docking mechanisms that allow them to form physically connected ‘super-robots’. Within the projects SYMBRION [9] and REPLICATOR [5] three types of such robot modules are developed (see Fig. 1(b)): backbone bot (strong main single-DOF actuator to move/rotate docked robots but also 2-DOF locomotion by a screw drive), scout bot (flexible locomotion), and active wheel (omnidirectional drive, ability to provide a lift for other robots).\cite{hamann2012towards}
\item variation in unit-to-unit specs \cite{pugh2007parallel} \cite{duarte2016evolution}
\end{itemize}

Potential alternate route: plasticity/role selection with different environmental conditions (requires stigmergic cues/memory (internal state)

Methods to evolve heterogeneousness cooperation:

explicit:

vs

implicit:

\begin{itemize}
\item explicit deme selection
\item individual selection (one population)
\begin{itemize}
  \item vertical transmission/
  \item implicit deme selection (meta)
  \item partner choice/reciprocal
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
  \item asdf
\end{itemize}
\item individual selection (one population per role) \cite{luke1996evolving}
\end{itemize}

Challenges to evolving heterogenous cooperation:

The three papers each suggests a solution to credit assignment problem

just heterogeneous genotypes
\cite{waibel2009genetic}
also \cite{perez2003effects}
group selection:
+ inefficient selection
individual selection:
+ defection/credit assignment
---> example where
suggestion: deme selection or direct credit assignment

heterogeneous genotypes and heterogeneous embodiment
\cite{knudson2010coevolution}
suggestion: deme selection while considering how each individual contributes by replay without the individual

cooperative co-evolution \cite{gomes2015cooperative}
credit assignment
suggestion: set up explicit roles, evaluate each with partner from other role who's really good

% reciprocity barrier
% suggestion: artificial selection
% \cite{andre2016evolutionary}


suggestion: cooperative co-evolution

each of these papers points towards explicit methods

but implicit for things like Symbrion \cite{kernbach2008symbiotic}

how to get implicit?

perhaps look towards biology \cite{vostinar2017suicide}

vertical transmission
