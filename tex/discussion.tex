\section{Discussion}

genetically homogenous groups == indirect encoding where symmetry between agents can be exploited
+ can we come up with another indrect encoding that still allows some amount of exploitation of symmetry? (e.g., some sharing of genetic configuration between agents)
+ add an input for hardware type

what are the benefits of genetic het?
The potential benefits of genetic heterogeneity related to exploiting the potential benefits of configuration heterogeneity.
LATER, however, there are other potential benefits WRT the process of evolution: open-endedness and diversity preservation etc.
However, due to the evolutionary algorithm, there are implications of this type of heterogeneity of configuration with respect to evolution because the
Genetic heterogeneity in natural evolution is facilitated and emerges in sophisticated ways through symbiotic relationships, transitions of individuality, vertical transmission, group selection, and ecological dynamics.
However, looking beyond just the immediate functionality of the genetically heterogeneous collective, some more nuanced benefits in terms of the evolutionary process might be appreciated.

+ don't have to manually determine composition of cooperating teams

implicitly evolve as part of a team genome \cite{bongard2000legion}
+ vertical transmission
